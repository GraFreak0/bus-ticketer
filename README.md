# Bus Ticketer Application
This application is PHP web application built to enable organization staff generate bus tickets from the comfort of their home/offices.
This aids in reducing the closing rush hour by enabling conducive and steezeful movement towards the staff buses.

### Measures of Implementation
- Platform will only be accessible by 5:00pm Africa/Lagos Time
- Staff can only generate code once to stop staffs from generating code for other (Each bus passenger must personally book their ticket).
- To enhance transparency and fairness, a list of staff names and their ticket ids is populated on the page.
- A countdown is implemented on the page so that users can time when the platform is opened.
